Engineering challenge

## Tasks

I was able to:

- fetch data from the graphql api
- design according the wireframe
- filter data according to type but still working on rendering the filtered data

I was not able to work on:

- the search functionality
- render filtered data

Reasons why i'm not able to complete the task according:

- saw the email late
- had to write the the graphql api myself, here is the repo to it: [mock data api](https://github.com/tolu-c/refactored-carnival)
